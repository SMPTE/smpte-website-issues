**Website Issue Tracker**

The SMPTE website (wwww.smpte.org) has been updated. While most SMPTE Standards webpages from the old website were taken over into the new website verbatim the refresh may have caused some issues. We need your help to identify any remaining issues and to record them in the issue tracker for this repository. The SMPTE Standards webpages can be accessed through the "Innovate" menu on the SMPTE website. Please focus on structural issues like broken or incorrect links and obviously wrong text.

Please note the following data when submitting issues
- Computer system
- OS version
- Browser with version info
- Provide the name of page where the issue was detected (if possible)
- Provide a link to the page where the issue was detected (if possible)
- Provide a detailed description of the issue

Please contact [SMPTE Standards Support](mailto:standards-support@smpte.org) if you have any questions.
